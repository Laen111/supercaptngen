# supercaptngen

Super Capt'n General: fork of [Capt'n General](https://github.com/aaronvincent/captngen), designed to handle supernovae boosting dark matter via scattering to above galactic escape velocities.

Can be run in standalone mode, or as a library (via the default `make gencaplib.so`).

Build for example standalone by calling `make gentest.x`.
See main.f90 for examples of how to call the executable, `gentest.x`.

If you use this code, you can cite **_NOT USED YET_** where it was first deployed.
