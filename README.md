# supercaptngen

Super Capt'n General: fork of [Capt'n General](https://github.com/aaronvincent/captngen), designed to handle supernovae boosting dark matter via scattering to above galactic escape velocities.

If you use this code, you can cite **_NOT USED YET_** where it was first deployed.

Run `make` to compile the library on its own.

If you want the test file as well, run `make supertest.x` which compiles the test script in _supermain.f90_.
The test main file shows how to work with Super Capt'n.

## TODO

- There is still an overall normalization difference between super and Chris' data?
- Refine user interface to Super Capt'n
- is there a fixed value we take if the DM kinetic energy exceeds the isotope's max energy transfer?
