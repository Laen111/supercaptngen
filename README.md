# supercaptngen

Super Capt'n General: fork of [Capt'n General](https://github.com/aaronvincent/captngen), designed to handle supernovae boosting dark matter via scattering to above galactic escape velocities.

If you use this code, you can cite **_NOT USED YET_** where it was first deployed.

Run `make` to compile the library on its own.

If you want the test file as well, run `make supertest.x` which compiles the test script in _supermain.f90_.
The test main file shows how to work with Super Capt'n.

## TODO

- Refine user interface to Super Capt'n
- In future: change $V_\text{shock}\left( t \right)$, or include a varying $V_\text{shock}\left( x, t \right)$ with position in the shockwave
